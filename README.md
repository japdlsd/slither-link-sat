slither-link-sat
================

This is a project for school course Project(1) and Project(2) in academic year 2014/15.

My goal is to use SAT-solver (or other artillery like ILP-solver) to compute stuff (solutions, unambiguos problem entries) related to the game [Slither Link](http://www.puzzle-loop.com/).
