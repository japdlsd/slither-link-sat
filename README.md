slither-link-sat
================

This is a project for school course Project(1) and Project(2) in academic year 2014/15. 
[project page (in Slovak)](http://japdlsd.github.io/rp/index.html)

My goal is to use SAT-solver (or other artillery like ILP-solver) to compute stuff (solutions, unambiguos problem entries) related to the game [Slither Link](http://www.puzzle-loop.com/).

All problem instances are taken from [puzzle-loop.com](http://puzzle-loop.com).
